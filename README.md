This script uses a raspberryPi connected to a 32x8 horizontal neopixel LED matrix in combination with an air pressure sensor and an usb audio device. 
As pressure builds to a set threshold, a music track begins playing and the LED matrix panel displays a rainbow colored theater chase animation.
When the pressure starts to release, the music track will begin to slow down unless the user maintains the threshold pressure. 
The neopixel LED matrix will show a progress bar that fills up or decreases along with the pressure reading when underneath the threashold.
